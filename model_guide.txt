The various different models behave in different ways, but all
are somewhat analogous to established physical laws.

Model 1: "High Ping" Acceleration

This model sets a velocity threshold above which acceleration is
flipped to be the negative of what it was initially. The threshold
velocity is also increased very slightly each time it is exceeded
such that acceleration still occurs, but oscillations in velocity
will occur frequently. The dependence of position and velocity 
on acceleration are kept the same as in classical mechanics.

Model 2: Low-Speed Relativistic Effects

This model essentially models relativistic effects but sets the
speed of light c = 50 m/s, a value that is many orders of magnitude
less than the actual value of c. Note that due to computational
limitations in the number of iterations, there is code in place 
to set boundary conditions such that the behavior conforms to 
expectations.

Model 3: Sinusoidal Second Law

This model takes Newton's second law and changes the relation
to a time-dependent sinusoidal one. This brings up a lot of
questions about the physicality of this scenario, but it can
slightly mirror simple harmonic oscillatory motion. There is
nothing special about relations between the three fundamental
position-related quantities in this model.

Model 4: Exponential Acceleration

In this model, acceleration is dependent on the velocity of the
object, causing it to exponentially increase as velocity increases.
The relation acts upon the speed of the object and not the velocity,
meaning that the direction of acceleration is preserved regardless
of the direction of the initial velocity.

The model uses computational methods to evaluate integral expressions,
so it can have some limitations due to computational limitations of the
creator's device.
