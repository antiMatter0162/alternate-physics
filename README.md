**READ MODEL_GUIDE BEFORE RUNNING THE SIMULATION!

This is a hypothetical kinematics simulation employing fundamental laws
of physics different from Newton's laws. There are a total of four alternate
physical systems, with most bearing a certain amount of resemblance to real
behavior, albeit at very different scales. Parameter customization is possible.
